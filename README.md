Project: Ha-ara (Lighting Experience)
Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to showcase a flagship product from the "Ha-ara" brand and provide customers with compelling reasons to upgrade their home lighting. The landing page features a captivating headline that introduces the brand's essence and invites the customer to explore a new standard of illumination.

The Vision: Control Over Atmosphere
I chose to focus on the fundamental benefit provided by Ha-ara bulbs: the ability to control both light intensity (dimming) and color temperature. This feature empowers customers to take full control over the design and atmosphere of their homes. I included visual demonstrations within the UI to help users visualize the transformative power of these bulbs.

Value Propositions: Why Invest?
Beyond aesthetics and ambiance, I addressed the practical question: "Why invest in replacing your home's lighting?". To answer this, I highlighted the core functional advantages of the product:

Energy Efficiency: Maximizing electricity savings through advanced technology.

Durability: Bulbs engineered for an exceptionally long lifespan.

Health & Wellbeing: A focus on eye health through stable, flicker-free lighting.

Smart Features & Innovation
In the final section, I showcased high-tech "nice-to-have" features that elevate the user experience, specifically the ability to control the lighting system via a mobile app and the various smart functions included.

CTA & Footer
Call to Action (CTA): The journey concludes by inviting customers to join the community and experience light in a new way, with a direct link to the official Ha-ara website.

Footer: The bottom of the page includes essential contact information and links to additional content pages.

AI Integration
Artificial Intelligence played a key role in this project:

Visual Content: AI tools were used to generate high-quality product imagery.

Development & Design: I utilized AI to optimize the code structure and refine the overall design aesthetic.
